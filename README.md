# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: `BUILD FAILED`

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI. The `expo build:android` command fails with a generic `BUILD FAILED` message, providing little to no actionable information for debugging.

## Problem
The main challenge is the lack of specific error details in the build logs. This often requires extensive manual checking of project configurations, dependencies, and the Android development environment.

## Solution
This repository includes potential solutions, focusing on common causes:
* **Checking Gradle Properties:** Ensuring correct configurations in `android/gradle.properties`
* **Dependency Conflicts:** Identifying and resolving conflicts between Expo modules and native Android libraries
* **Android SDK Issues:** Troubleshooting issues within the Android SDK and related tools.
