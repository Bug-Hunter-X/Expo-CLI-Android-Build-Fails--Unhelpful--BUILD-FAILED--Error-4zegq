Debugging this error requires a systematic approach:

1. **Examine the Complete Build Log:** Carefully review the entire build log output for any clues, even seemingly insignificant warnings. Often, hidden details precede the `BUILD FAILED` message.
2. **Verify Gradle Properties:** Check the `android/gradle.properties` file for correct settings related to SDK versions, build tools, and other crucial configurations.  Incorrect versions or missing properties can lead to build failures.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Execute `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android` again. Cleaning the project sometimes resolves temporary issues.
4. **Check Dependencies:** Examine your `package.json` to ensure there aren't conflicts between different packages or versions. Try updating or downgrading potentially problematic libraries.
5. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio (if you're using it) or your IDE to refresh the development environment. This step can resolve cache-related problems.
6. **Android SDK and Tools:** Verify that your Android SDK is correctly installed and configured. Make sure you have the necessary build tools and platform-tools installed.
7. **Enable Verbose Logging (if applicable):** If possible, enable verbose logging during the build process to obtain more detailed output that may highlight the underlying cause.

If none of these steps resolve the problem, consider creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue and share it on the Expo forums or GitHub for community support.
