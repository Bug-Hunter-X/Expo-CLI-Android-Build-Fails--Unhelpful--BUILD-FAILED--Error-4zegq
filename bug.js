This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `build` command failing with the message `BUILD FAILED`.  The log often doesn't give a clear indication of the root cause, making it difficult to debug.  The error can stem from various issues such as incorrect configurations in the `android/gradle.properties` file, missing dependencies, conflicts between Expo modules and native Android libraries, or problems with the Android SDK setup itself.  A common symptom is a lack of specific error messages in the build output, leading to extensive troubleshooting.
